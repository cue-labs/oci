This does mean that if there\u0027s a hash algorithm that starts with a dot, we\u0027ll end up with an invalid tag, but in _practice_ the only algorithm that\u0027s ever used is \"sha256\" (many things would break if that changed), and any new algorithm will almost certainly have a short alphanumeric name) so I can\u0027t see this ever actually being an issue.",
