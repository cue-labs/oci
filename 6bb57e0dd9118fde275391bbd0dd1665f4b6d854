      "message": "This particular rule surprises me. I would assume that other immutable tag registries allow you to e.g. run the same `docker push` command with the same contents multiple times in a row without failure, since it technically does not violate immutability.\n\nAllowing this would also simplify idempotent/reproducible retries, for example if a CI job on master which publishes a \"dev\" commit version needs to be re-run a few times to investigate a flake, it would be unfortunate if `cue mod publish` failed after the first successful attempt, even with the same contents.",
