      "message": "The devil is in the Detail. üòä For a WireError, I use json.RawMessage because that effectively delays the interpretation of the detail until someone decides to unmarshal it into a struct. NewError is more aimed at a interface returning some Go value to be (eventually) marshaled.\n\nBut now that I\u0027m writing it down like this, I realise that neither is great. If you _actually_ want to look at the detail inside a given error, you won\u0027t be able to rely on any particular Go data type, so you\u0027ll probably end up round-tripping via JSON anyway...\n\nI\u0027m thinking that maybe we should make (another!) API-breaking change, changing Detail to return json.RawMessage rather than `any`.",
